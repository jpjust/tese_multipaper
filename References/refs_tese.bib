  abstract   = {While the world still struggles against the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and organisations are discussing how new technologies can be exploited to relieve its impacts and how future pandemics can be avoided or minimised. Among the envisioned solutions, the development of more efficient and widespread smart city initiatives can improve the way critical data is retrieved, processed, stored, and disseminated, potentially improving the detection and mitigation of outbreaks while reducing the execution time when taking critical actions. In fact, some first responses to this pandemic are exploiting different technological solutions that could be ultimately adopted in more integrated city-scale systems, opening many possibilities. Therefore, this study discusses potential solutions and review recent approaches that can be exploited in this complex scenario, describing feasible and promising development trends for the construction of the new expected health-centric smart cities.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the major cities of the world have to solve problems that were unthinkable in past decades. Due to the population growing rate, new issues are still arising, but technology can be used to address such issues and improve life quality in big cities. In that scenario, surveillance is a highly desired service and most governments are already using different types of devices to provide high levels of security. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) can be used to monitor every part of a city without the cost of running cables all over it. However, there must be an efficient way to gather all information collected by the sensors and cameras, with reduced energy consumption and average latency. This work proposes a new algorithm to position multiple mobile sinks in WVSN deployed along roads and streets. A relevance-based approach was designed to position sinks closer to source nodes with higher sensing relevance, since they are expected to transmit more data packets. The proposed algorithm can detect forbidden and disconnected zones, making sure sinks will be positioned in permitted areas, which makes this approach very suitable for realistic smart city applications.},

Our work focuses on benchmarking neighborhood resilience by developing a unified, multi-factor index of local and regional resilience capacity: the Resilience to Emergencies and Disasters Index (REDI). The strength of the REDI methodology is the integration of measures of physical, natural, and social systems – operationalized through the collection and analysis of large-scale, heterogeneous, and high resolution urban data – to classify and rank the relative resilience capacity embedded in localized urban systems. Feature selection methodologies are discussed to justify the selection of included indicator variables. Hurricane Sandy is used to validate the REDI scores by measuring the recovery periods for neighborhoods directly impacted by the storm. Using over 12,000,000 records for New York City’s 311 service request system, we develop a proxy for neighborhood activity, both pre- and post-event. Hurricane Sandy had a significant and immediate impact on neighborhoods classified as least resilient based on the calculated REDI scores, while the most resilient neighborhoods were shown to better withstand disruption to normal activity patterns and more quickly recover to pre-event functional capacity.},

The higher the index, more resilient the region is, i.e. more quickly it can recover from an emergence event. The authors evaluated their approach calculating REDI values for New York City and comparing their calculated indices to recover time from Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. They showed a correlation between REDI value and recover time. Regions with higher REDI values had fewer impact and less recovery time while lower REDI regions were most impacted by the event and took longer to recover from it.},

Their system uses smart sensors for temperature monitoring, indoor and outdoor drones for image monitoring and temperature sensing and beacon-enabled smart IDs for occupants localization, that communicates to a control server using AllJoyn Security Platform to avoid malicious interventions. In order to detect fire harzards, the smart sensors are installed at the entrance of each room of the building to constantly monitor its temperature. When there is a temperature change, the smart sensor communicates the new value to the control server. If the temperature is above a specific threshold, the sensor changes its status from "Active" to "Unsage", indicating a abnormal situation. The drones receive this information and fly to the room to inspect it, making photos and videos that are sent to the control server. A security manager receives the alert via an app and checks if it is an abnormal situation. If this is the case, the manager confirms the abnormal situation and the control server alerts all the occupants, using their smart IDs beacons to detect their positions and guide to the nearest exit route. Such system can both monitor and alert the occupants in a fire harzard situation, preventing false alarms with the aid of the security manager. The occupants' smart IDs beacos can also be useful in a disaster event, after a building collapses. The beacons sent by the smart IDs can help first responders to locate victims under building debris.

  review        = {In this paper the authors use machine learning for a smart fire detection system. Their approach combines an integrated sensor system (smoke, heat and flame detectors) that monitors a room, sending sensing data to a micro-controller. Instead of just comparing the sensed values with a set of thresholds, machine learning algorithms analyze the measurements and output the fire danger level. When the fire danger level raises above a potential level threshold, camera sensors sends images of the scene to the micro-controller that, once again, makes use of machine learning algorithms to analyze the image and enhance the fire danger level. If the system detects fire, some automatic actions are performed: cut off electric power, turn on sprinkles, alarm and notifies authorities via a GSM module. The authors compared 16 machine learning algorithms against a dataset of 102 samples and found out that in all measures LMT, MultilayerPerceptron and SimpleLogistics algorithms showed 100% accuracy. They argue that by using machine learning algorithms to validate sensing data the system can procude appropriate outputs and eliminate false alarms.

The goal is to reduce the evacuation time in a exceeding capacity parking facility in case of an emergency. The authors argue that while it is easy to implement positioning solutions in outdoor environments, indoor scenarios pose more difficulty because of constraints that are leveraged by large obstacles as walls and others cars. This framework then uses several technologies for cars positioning: RFID, Wi-Fi hotspots, bluetooth and UWB devices. Also, smartphones inside the vehicles have been used to detect acceleration and deacceleration. To evalueate the approach, the authors first tested the technologies in a real environment, using a multi-level parking facility and ten vehicles. They deployed several RFIDs sensors, Wi-Fi, bluetooth and UWB hardware along the parking to detect the position of the cars. The tests had shown that the use of these technologies makes it possible: the RFID tags inside the vehicles could inform their position in a feasible accuracy while the UWB hardware was capable of detecting their movements. For a final evaluation, they simulated this environment using AIMSUN simulator, MATLAB and Python scripts for four scenarios: normal operation (vehicles must use the regular exits of the parking facility to evacuate), ramp reversal scenario (vehicles are allowed to use the ramps for evacuation), counter flow (in addition of using ramps, the vehicles can also use the entrances for evacuation) and counter flow plus two lanes (the corridors of the parking facility are used as two lanes). The simulations have shown that there is a decrease between 34.74% and 42.31% in evacuation time comparing the counter flow plus two lanes scenario with normal operation. The authors argue that these positioning technologies are suitable for the task of planing evacuation strategies in indoor environments.

The authors argue that by crowdsensing and analysing these data one is capable of creating more appropriate smart city solutions for the citizens, since it enables to gather information about where and when people use the city services. They formalize the challenges of LBSM crowdsensing into a framework of four aspects that demand attention, called the four-W: who, where, when and what. By analysing each of these aspects, a researcher can then pay attention to the kinds of biases that are present in social media data. Who is posting can be biased by socio demographic issues, where it was posted can be biased by social attractions in a city, when to post can be biased by work and leizure hours and what to post can be biased by people's interest in a region. The authors emphasizes that all these questions must be considered when crowdsensing social media data to avoid unaccuracy in a smart city application.

Tweets before and after the two incidents were collected and filtered by the LDA model to label them by topics. After some manual checking to assign the selected topics to incidents types, a seconda LDA model is run to classify the tweets. After running the tests, the approach performed well, extracting incident-related tweets with high accuracy. By using this approach for classifying Twitter data, it is possible to get incidents-related information in real-time and aid emergency response personnel.

In this paper the authors propose a crowdsource mapping approach to provide geolocation of buildings in harzard. They developed a smartphone app so volunteer users can use it when facing a building in harzard. When an user gets close to such event, it can then run the app to collect positional information, take photos and send to a central database that will contain information about the emergency. To properly get the correct location, the app can use GPS for initial positioning and then, the user can improve the positioning by choosing a point on the map, entering geocoding information such as address or use the device's camera, accelerometer and mangnetic sensor, so that the app will try to calculate the user's distance from the building. This correction is necessary because when facing a building in harzard, the users will not get too close for his/her own safety, thus, the GPS sensor will not get the precise position. By collecting data from volunteers, a central service can be notified on the occurence of an emergency and get the exact location for first responders. Seventeen volunteers were given the experimental app to test it and answer a questionnari to evaluate the system. 82\% of respondents agreed or totally agreed that this approach is preferable over telephone communication for emergencies alerting and 94\% agreed or totally agreed that this system could complement the current disaster information systems.

Called Earthquake Emergency Micro Response System (EEMRS), their approach is compound of a smart-watch application that reads users' heart rate and GPS position and sends it to a remote database. In case of an earthquake, the victims' health situation can be rapidly identified by their heart rate (readings under 60 bpm and over 120 bpm may indicate injury) as also their location, helping first responders to take decision on where to go first and how to find the victims. The authors have done a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with the Tokyo Fire Department Emergency Response Experts to evaluate their proposal. The FGD responders fulfilled a questionnare about how the proposed system would help them in a post earthquake situation. The questionnare revealed that knowing the real-time movement and health conditions of victims would be of great help, and that the combination of already existing tools with this new approach would be of greate competence.

When the fire emergency is detected and the fire department is alerted, the sensors send real-time data about the situation on the floor to an external server. The sensors can detect the fire ignition points as also the position of the occupants of the building through a mobile app installed in their smartphones, generating evacuation paths for the occupants. On the arrival of the firefighters, an on-site commander gets visual data about the incident through the proposed system and can guide the firefighters to go through the informed paths by the application. The authors simulated four scenarios in the International Building of the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST): before firefigthers enter the scene, after the firefighters enter the scene, multiple ignition points and path planning for fire extinguishment. In all scenarios, the proposed system showed the appropriate paths for rescuing (high priority), avoiding passing through ignition points, and fire extinguishment.

To evaluate their proposal, the authors simulated their algorithm against two recent published solutions: two-phase heirustic algorithm (TPH) and the parallel improved ant colony optimization algorithm (PIACO).

  review        = {In this paper the authors propose a neural network based mechanism to classify post-disaster images and aid in rescuing decisions. Their approach is two use machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to inspect photographies of a post-disaster environment taken from disaster relief organizations and detect if there are humans needing rescuing. The architecture is divided in three layers: data collection, pre-processing and image classification. First, images are retrieved from specific datasets and social media from disaster relief organizations in the data collection phase. Then, manual filtering, labeling, normalization and transformation of images are performed in the pre-processing phase, to ensure relevance of selected images. Finally, in the image classification phase, ML and DL algorithms are used to classify images, searching for humans or humans body parts. This final classification is then used to aid first responders and decision makers in the rescuing process, prioritizing sites with higher probability of victims, thus, saving as many lives as possible. To evaluate their proposal, the authors tested two ML techniques: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); and three DL techniques: ResNet-50, Inception V3 and AlexNet. These techniques were tested aganst a dataset of images from the earthquake-hit regions of Tohoku, Japan. They found that ResNet-50 and Intercepvion V3 overperformed all the other techniques. For future work, the authors aim to integrate information from other sources as text from social media.

  review        = {In this paper the authors developed a mobile application for Emergency Notifications (EN). The work emphasizes the importance of human notifications of emergencies. Although there are sensing technology to detect some emergency situations, human interaction is of high accuracy as people surrouding the affected area can quickly describe what is happening to authorities. For large-scale situations as flooding, earthquakes, etc., social media is already being used for detection, as people usually post messages and multimedia data of such events, while automated tools can mine social media data to detect such emergencies. When facing small-scale events, as a car accident, social media is not very useful because the amount of messages posted by surrouding people have a small significance compared to the total number of messages in a social network, thus, making it difficult for detection. Instead of relying in social media for small-scale emergencies, the authors state that specific EN applications are more accurate and useful. In this context, they developed an application taking into consideration its ease of use and effectiveness. To evaluate their mobile application, they performed two tests: an usability test and a simulated test. In the usability test, they asked some participants to try and use the application as if there was an emergency, to test the usability of the interface. The results of this first test were satisfactory: 60% of the users stated that they would use the application as a witness and 30% would use both as a witness and as a victim. In the simulated test, they asked some participants to install and try the application in their smartphones. After a while, a simulated car accident suddenly started in the surrouding, so the paticipants could use the application to report the emergency. After the test, authorities were asked to evaluate the results and they were satisfactory: photos and videos of the accident were of great importance, because it would made possible for the emergency operator to quickly know what kind of situation has occured and how to proceed. Also, the GPS information could provide the operators an accurate localization of the emergency, instead of relying of people's description. The authors concluded that this approach for emergency reporting does not substitude an ordinary emergency call, but can improve the accuracy of emergency reports.

Some of these events can propagate and start other events as a domino-effect, thus, mitigating these problems are of great importance in a post-earthquake scenario. The authors argue that there is a lack of a model that studies the degradation of complex systems after an earthquake, so, their algorithm proposes to calculate the restoration time, i.e. the time needed since the earthquake back to an under control state, combining the harzardous of each possible post-earthquake event and travel time of authorities from a response center. Their model was tested in MATLAB and could calculate the restoration time in 10 simulated cases.

When some monitoring systems based on wireless sensor networks are deployed, sensing and transmission configurations of sensor nodes may be adjusted exploiting the relevance of the considered events, but efficient detection and classification of events of interest may be hard to achieve. In Smart City environments, several people spontaneously post information in social media about some event that is being observed and such information may be mined and processed for detection and classification of critical events. This article proposes an integrated approach to detect and classify events of interest posted in social media, notably in Twitter, and the assignment of sensing priorities to source nodes. By doing so, wireless sensor networks deployed in Smart City scenarios can be optimized for higher efficiency when monitoring areas under the influence of the detected events.},

The global population crosses 7.7 billion with the loss of biodiversity, increasing pressure on food, water, and energy resources. The migration of people from rural to urban in large scale is a matter of concern; as the global urban population will almost reach 68\% by 2050, approximately 6 billion. A very high concentration of people living in urban areas and growth projection pose a serious challenge for large cities for vulnerability. Amongst the several challenges, food security will be a serious issue for the future of cities. In this context, the Fourth Industrial Revolution and movement towards creating Smart Cities have to provide solutions and opportunities to deal with those challenges. In this opinion paper, we seek to discuss the future of cities, with a holistic vision of several actions to deal with food security challenges in urban centers.},

Restoration time is the time required after the occurence of an emergency event for the resources to arrive at the event site and restore it to a stable situation. The authors model is based on their previous work presented in [xx], involving state transitions to model the event and calculate the restoration time. In their approach, they consider fire, gas leakage, building collapsing and flooding events, being flooding considered in a secondary state, i.e., the worst kind of incident. Their model was implemented using MATLAB and 1,000,000~h of simulation time was performed in a low probability of flooding scenario in St. Louis, USA. The simulation has shown that as more resources are used to mitigate the situation, less response time is required. The travel time, i.e., the time needed to travel from the resources center to the crisis area, has little influence in the resulting restoration time compared to the number of resources available. This behavior was the same in a high probability of flooding scenario. The authors argue that their model is helpful in smart cities initiatives to previously plan and predict mitigation efforts in emergency situations.

According to the authors, there was no solution for crowdsensing social media in Arabic world, mixing Modern standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialect Arabic (DA), which hardens the detection of events in social media text. To solve this problem, their framework used text mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to filter and classify datasets from Twitter, generating event reports. To validate their proposal, they evaluated the employed text classification methods: Polynomial Networks (PN), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Rachio (RA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Their tests showed that PN ourperformed all other methods with a classification accuracy of 93.56~% without stemmer and 96.49~% with stemmer, although stemming increases PN's response time from 12~s to 1~min and 45~s. Also, this framework was capable of generating an event report from Twitter data, helping first responders to be aware of an incident as soon as it happens.

This protocol allows the network to prioritize energy saving in normal operation, switching to a low-latency mode when in alerting state. Also, they developed a complete 3D platform to render the emergency area remotely in the cloud, creating a virtual environment that reflects the actual situation, providing first responders a visualization of the target site. Data received from the WSN are used to re-create the emergencies in the virtual environment, helping authorities, providing a mitigation plan based on a multi-objective multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP). The proposed routing protocol was simulated, showing that it can provide a balanced energy consumption and latency compared to latency and energy-only prioritization algorithms. The multi-objective optimization algorithm proposed outperformed a single-objective approach, making it suitable for a real-case scenario. And finally, the 3D engine designed by the authors could re-create an emergency scenario based on WSN data.

Communication infrastructure as Wi-Fi and mobile phone networks may be unavaiable after an earthquake, thus, the proposed system does not rely on such infrastrucuture to operate. The system then uses fixed anchors inside the monitored building that communicate to wearable tags using an autonomous ultra-wide band (UWB) network. The tag is also a health monitor, that senses user's heart rate and oximetry. In this way, the system can not only localize victims after a disaster but also monitors their health status, making it possible to prioritize most injured users. To gather the data inside the building, ZigBee routers forward data to an external coordinator, which feeds a graphical application that can be used by rescuers to localize the victims in a map and monitor their health status. All the hardware are battery-powered, so it does not depend on mains power supply. To evaluate their proposal, the authors implemented the system and tested it inside the Geotechnical and Building Engineering at the Technical University of Turin, Italy. Eight anchors were positioned in a corridor and two participants were wearing tags. The graphical application could properly localize the participants and monitor their health conditions. Also, the system had an accuraacy of 46.5\~cm at a 15\~distance. They also tested their system in a large room, in which it had an accuracy of 54\~cm at the same distance.

This device have two working modes: normal operation and emergency operation. In normal operation, the Smart Box acts as a sensing node, collecting air quality data and sending to a central application. In emergency mode, the device switchs to an access point state, enabling first responders and citizens to connect to its Wi-Fi mesh networking and have connectivity in a post-disaster scenario, when ordinary communication infrastructure may be in a failing state. To achieve this goal, the tens or hunderds of Smart Boxes must be deployed in the city, so they can connect to each other forming a Wi-Fi mesh network. If any intermediate Smart Box fails, preventing the connection of two sets of nodes, these clusters operate apart, so first responders can still have some communication.

  review        = {In this paper the authors propose a traffic lights management system to prioritize emergency vehicles. Their system has two parts: an Arduino board connected to the Internet that controls traffic lights and an Android application that communicates with the Arduino board. Inside the emergency vehicle, a co-pilot is responsible for operating the Android application in a smartphone. In an emergency situation, the co-pilot enables the application and controls the semaphors by selecting to go straight, which will turn the green light on, or turn left, which will turn the green left arrow light on. The GPS data sent by the Android device will tell the Arduino board when the vehicle is no longer in the semaphor area, putting it back to its normal operation. The proposed approach was tested in a simulated environment, using LEDs connected to Arduino boards as traffic lights, which were controlled as expected. They argue that this application can reduce arrival time of ambulances and other emergency vehicles.

Kind of approach: mitigation},
