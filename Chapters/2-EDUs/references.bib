  review    = {In this paper the authors propose a methodology to calculate a resilience index for neighborhoods of a city. They use several tracts categorized into four domains: (1) social infrastructure and community connectivity, (2) physical infrastructure, (3) economic strength and (4) environmental conditions. 24 indicator variables were used to compute REDI for each region. The higher the index, more resilient the region is, i.e. more quickly it can recover from an emergence event. The authors evaluated their approach calculating REDI values for New York City and comparing their calculated indices to recover time from Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. They showed a correlation between REDI value and recover time. Regions with higher REDI values had fewer impact and less recovery time while lower REDI regions were most impacted by the event and took longer to recover from it.}
