  review    = {In this paper the authors propose a methodology to calculate a resilience index for neighborhoods of a city. They use several tracts categorized into four domains: (1) social infrastructure and community connectivity, (2) physical infrastructure, (3) economic strength and (4) environmental conditions. 24 indicator variables were used to compute REDI for each region. The higher the index, more resilient the region is, i.e. more quickly it can recover from an emergence event. The authors evaluated their approach calculating REDI values for New York City and comparing their calculated indices to recover time from Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. They showed a correlation between REDI value and recover time. Regions with higher REDI values had fewer impact and less recovery time while lower REDI regions were most impacted by the event and took longer to recover from it.}

  review    = {In this paper the authors propose a black-box approach for smart traffic lights management. In their approach, a black-box system receives input data from the vehicles on the intersecting roads to handle traffic lights. Depending on the traffic on each road and lane, the system can switch lights in order to improve traffic and reduce waiting times. The authors simulated a 24 hour traffic with three scenarios: fixed time traffic lights, fully controlled with IEEE 802.11p communications and fully controlled with LTE-V2V communications. As expected, fixed time traffic lights had the worst performance, exceeding 400 seconds of waiting time in some cases. By using IEEE 802.11p, the simulations presented a worst case scenario of 185.75 seconds with an average of 48.82 seconds of waiting time. At last, by using LTE-V2V for communications, the simulation presented a worst case scenario of 185.75 seconds, the same as IEEE 802.11p, but an average of 53.81 seconds, showing that the IEEE 802.11p approach gives the best results. Although these results favor IEEE 802.11p, the average difference is of only 5 seconds. The authors argue that the choice of LTE-V2V communications technology may be more viable because of the spread of 5G technologies, thus, it can make use of existing infrastructure.}

  review    = {In this paper the authors propose a resilience index called Climatic Hazard Resilience Indicators for Localities (CHRIL). They used four main indicators categories: inherent biophysical conditions, inherent socioeconomic conditions, institutional and infrastructural capacity, and adaptive capacity and learning. To assess their proposal, a total of 10 experts and officers participated in a questionnaire survey to indicate an importance level of each indicator in all categories. The main idea of the authors is to mainstream the community participation in the process so the resulting planning that can have the stakeholders experience and opinions. In the validation process, the authors applied their index in Taichung City, Taiwan. They obtained a resilience map of the city in every indicator category as also a composite index containing an average of all categories. Lastly, they define three clusters of areas in the city, each cluster having a predominant index value (low, medium and high resilience).
               
               Alguns fatos interessantes:
               
               1) Os autores segmentaram as regiões pelos bairros, uma ideia que eu também estava imaginando.
               2) Os indicadores de risco são relacionados a chuvas e tufões. Para outros tipos de ameaças esses índices provavelmente não seriam válidos, o que reforça minha ideia de que é preciso definir as ameaças primeiro.}

  review    = {In this paper the authores propose a GIS-MCDA based approach for asessing vulnerability to flooding in parishes in Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal. The authors used a three-level hierarchical social vulnerability model. In the first level, they considered four objectives: population, buildings, socio-economics and exposed elements. For each objective, up to two levels of attributes that influence the vulnerability in the region were given. For example, in population objective (first level), the age attribute (second level) can be separeted in three groups (third level): under 14, upper 64 and between 14 and 64. Each group can have a different impact in the vulnerability of the region. Also, for each attribute, a panel of specialists assigned a criteria weight to be used in aggregation methods to calculate the vulnerability of each perish. The authors applied their approach in Vila Nova de Gaia and the results were consistent with the empirical knowledge of the regions.}

Ele servirá como referência quando afirmarmos que dados históricos também têm valor na hora de definir o risco de uma zona. Neste caso, eles usam dados históricos pra definirem as probabilidades de mortalidade por calor, além de definir um limiar de temperatura o qual, a partir daí, supõe-se que a temperatura está muito arriscada.
               
               Se considerarmos o histórico de uma região quanto a uma ameaça específica, podemos dizer que essa região tem um risco elevado.}
